# Extracting strings

Let's assume you've [annotated your application](/dev-guide/annotate/). It's now time to extract these strings into a translation template. This is a `.pot` file: a standard gettext template that lists all the strings that should be translated.

[Angular-gettext-tools](https://github.com/rubenv/angular-gettext-tools) is the official library to extract strings from HTML templates and JavaScript code. Several wrappers exist that integrate it with other tools:

Official:

* [Grunt plugin](https://github.com/rubenv/grunt-angular-gettext)

Third party

* [Gulp plugin](https://github.com/gabegorelick/gulp-angular-gettext)
* [CLI utility](https://github.com/huston007/angular-gettext-cli)
* [Webpack loader (compilation)](https://github.com/princed/angular-gettext-loader)
* [Webpack plugin (compilation and extraction)](https://github.com/augusto-altman/angular-gettext-plugin)

In this example, we will use a [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) task to do this. If you haven't used Grunt before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-angular-gettext --save-dev
```
Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```javascript
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-angular-gettext');
```

This plugin actually provides two task types: `nggettext_extract` and `nggettext_compile`. We'll use the former right now. The latter will be used later on, to combine the translations with your application.

In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `nggettext_extract` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
  nggettext_extract: {
    pot: {
      files: {
        'po/template.pot': ['src/views/*.html']
      }
    },
  },
})
```

After running `grunt`, this will create a `.pot` file. You can open this with any normal text editor: verify that your annotated strings are in there.

## Using custom delimiters

If you've configured Angular.JS to use other expression delimiters than `{{` and `}}`, be sure to update the configuration for `nggettext_extract` accordingly:

```javascript
grunt.initConfig({
  nggettext_extract: {
    pot: {
      options: {
        startDelim: '[[',
        endDelim: ']]'
      },
      files: {
        'po/template.pot': ['src/views/*.html']
      }
    },
  },
})
```
